# How to Answer Questions

Each time you answer a question, fill out the space provided for the answer to the question.

```text
## Question X - Title

Query Solution:

```js
	db.collection_name.find();
	```
```

The NoSQL code used to answer the question is contained in a code block, as shown above. 

It is important that code blocks start at the beginning of the line for formatting on GitHub, Obsidian or your preferred IDE render the code correctly.

Images are embedded using the following syntax:

```markdown
![Short Image Title](./folder/filename.extension)
```

For example:

```markdown
![Embedding an Image Example](./assets/step-N-XXX.png)
```

Gives:

# Step 2: NoSQL Systems

## 2.1 Identify Data Types

| Item         | Data Type |
|--------------|-----------|
| id           | Object ID |
| title        | String    |
| year         | Int32           |
| writer       | Array of strings| 
| summary      | String| 
| franchise    | String  | 
| running time | Int32  |
| budget       | Decimal 128 |
| box office   | Decimal 128 | 




# Step 3: NoSQL Databases & Collections

## 11.2 Testing the insert trigger works correctly

- Use the following data to check the trigger functions as expected:

Query Solution:

```js
	db.collection_name.find();
```

## 11.3 Create trigger for updated data

- Create a trigger that monitors the movies collection for new data being added. 

Query Solution:

```js
	db.collection_name.find();
```

Screen Shot:

> Replace this line with a screenshot of the output from the creation of the trigger.

## 11.4 Testing the update trigger works correctly

Query Solution:

```js
	db.collection_name.find();
```

## 11.5 Create trigger for deleted data

- Create a trigger that monitors the movies collection for new data being added.
